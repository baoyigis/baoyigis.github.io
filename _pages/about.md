I am Yi Bao, an Assistant Professor at Nanjing University, focusing on urban spatiotemporal big data mining and sustainable development research. My research interests include high-resolution urban built environment research, exploration of interaction mechanisms between built environment and human activities, as well as geographic intelligence LLM and GeoAI applications.

I received my Ph.D. in Cartography and Geographic Information Systems from Peking University in 2023.Before joining Nanjing University, I worked as a Boya Postdoctoral Fellow at the Institute of Remote Sensing and Geographic Information System, Peking University, where I was supported by the Postdoctoral Innovation Talent Support Program (BoXin Program).

I currently lead multiple research projects, including the National Natural Science Foundation of China Youth Program, dedicated to solving key scientific problems in urban sustainable development through big data and artificial intelligence technologies.

I welcome collaborations and discussions! I am currently recruiting master's students, doctoral students, postdoctoral researchers, and research assistants to join our team.
